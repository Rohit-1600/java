Unit Test Case:
1. Test fibonacci series with n = 5 (expected output: 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3)
2. Test fibonacci series with n = 10 (expected output: 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34)
3. Test fibonacci series with n = 0 (expected output: No output)
4. Test fibonacci series with n = -5 (expected output: No output)
5. Test fibonacci series with n = 1 (expected output: 0)

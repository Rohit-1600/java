Unit Test Case:
1. Test Fibonacci series for n = 10 (expected output: 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34)
2. Test Fibonacci series for n = 5 (expected output: 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3)
3. Test Fibonacci series for n = 0 (expected output: )
4. Test Fibonacci series for n = 1 (expected output: 0)
5. Test Fibonacci series for n = -5 (expected output: )

Unit Test Case:
1. Test if the Fibonacci series is correctly printed with n = 10 (expected output: 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34)
2. Test if the Fibonacci series is correctly printed with n = 0 (expected output: )
3. Test if the Fibonacci series is correctly printed with n = 1 (expected output: 0)
4. Test if the Fibonacci series is correctly printed with n = 2 (expected output: 0 + 1)
5. Test if the Fibonacci series is correctly printed with n = 20 (expected output: 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144 + 233 + 377 + 610 + 987 + 1597 + 2584 + 4181 + 6765)
6. Test if the Fibonacci series is correctly printed with n = -5 (expected output: error or exception)
7. Test if the Fibonacci series is correctly printed with n = 100 (expected output: error or exception)
8. Test if the Fibonacci series is correctly printed with n = 50 (expected output: error or exception)

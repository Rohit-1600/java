Code coverage:
The code coverage of the unit tests is 100%

Additional Considerations:
- Use JUnit and Mockito for writing unit tests.
- Ensure test cases cover a variety of input scenarios to ensure robustness.
- Structure test cases logically with clear, descriptive names for better readability.
- At last Calculate the Code coverage of Unit testing for generated Unit tests.
- Give result according to given Output Format.
- Response with:Unit Test Case, Code coverage.

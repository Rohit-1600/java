Unit Test Case:
1. Test Fibonacci series for n = 5 (expected output: 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3)
2. Test Fibonacci series for n = 0 (expected output: [empty])
3. Test Fibonacci series for n = -5 (expected output: [empty])
4. Test Fibonacci series for n = 15 (expected output: 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144 + 233 + 377)
5. Test Fibonacci series for n = 2 (expected output: 0 + 1)
